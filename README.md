## ðŸš€ Overview

This project provides an **AI-powered system designed to review content, particularly from books on Pakistan's history and politics.** Its primary goal is to identify text segments that may not align with official Pakistani policies, national narratives, or cultural sensitivities.

Leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain, LangGraph, and a robust MongoDB/ChromaDB backend, this system automates the preliminary review process, highlighting potentially problematic content for further human examination.

### âœ¨ Key Features:

* **Dynamic Agent-Based Review:** Customizable review agents (e.g., historical accuracy, cultural sensitivity) loaded dynamically from MongoDB.
* **LLM-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes powerful LLMs (Groq, Llama) for in-depth content evaluation.
* **Vector-Based Knowledge Base:** Integrates a ChromaDB knowledge base to provide contextual information and official narratives to agents.
* **PDF Processing:** Extracts and chunks text from PDF documents for systematic review.
* **Zero-Shot Text Classification:** Categorizes text segments (e.g., military events, historical figures) using a transformer-based classifier to route to relevant agents.
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates detailed reports on identified issues, confidence scores, and recommendations (delete, rephrase, fact-check, human review).
* **Persistent Data Storage:** Uses MongoDB for storing PDF data, agent configurations, knowledge base information, and final analysis results.
